* Choose a theme for your game!

    * I incorporated a movie poster and movie quote to populate when word is guessed correctly.

    * A meme and "You Lost! Try Again!" populate if the word is guessed incorrectly.

    ![Lose](https://github.com/pamelatholan/Word-Guess-Game/blob/master/assets/images/lose.PNG)
    * If something other than a letter is pressed, an alert pops up.
    
* Display the following on the page:
    * Press any key to get started!
    * Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).
    * Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
    * Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).
        * If selecting a letter already guessed, do not subtract from number of turns remaining.

* After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.



* Used Javascript learned in class and independent learning done on Codecademy to create project.

#### Redid project using Bootstrap for a cleaner playing area that could scale more easily.  
#### Added media queries for mobile responsiveness.  
#### CSS styling cleaned up with the addition of bootstrap as images didn't need as much manipulation to populate in the playing area.
